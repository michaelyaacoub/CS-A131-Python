Write a program that asks the user to input a set of floating-point values. 
When the user enters a value that is not a number, 
give the user a second chance to enter the value. After two chances, 
quit reading input. 
Add all correctly specified values and print 
the sum when the user is done entering data. 
Use exception handling to detect improper inputs.

    # ask user for input
    # use a try catch to ask them to re-enter for couple times.
    # after second chance exit and sum up the entered values.
    # initialize sum with zero '0' and return it if not proper input.
    # else return sum.
    # loop through the input.
