There's only One strong enough to save
There's only One who overcame the grave
There's only One who's worthy of all praise
And in His hands, the keys of death and hell
And in His name, a power that can heal
And by His blood, our sins are washed away
His name is Jesus

Counselor, Almighty God!
Nations kneel
And glorify the Lord!
Let all the earth
Tremble for He comes!
And He will judge the living and the dead!
The Son of Man coming on the clouds
With trumpet sound and every knee will bow
And tongue confess the Name above all names!
