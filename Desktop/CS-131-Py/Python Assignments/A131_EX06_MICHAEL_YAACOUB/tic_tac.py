Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe.
The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid as in the photo at right.
The game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with
a circle, the second with a cross. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical,
or diagonal sequence of three marks wins. Your program should draw the game board, ask the user
for the coordinates of the next mark,
change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.
