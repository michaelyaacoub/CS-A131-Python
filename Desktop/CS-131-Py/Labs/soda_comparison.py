# 1- Check number of cans per pack
# 2- Then ounces per can, then multiply it by the amount of cans_per_pack to get the total value of soda
# 3- Check the ounces per liter
# 4- Then multiply the amount of ounces per liter to get the total value of soda
# 5- store the value in a varaible for both NUMBER_OF_CANS = 6 // OUNCE_PER_CAN = 12

 
#-------Result-------#

# 1- if value of soda_in_pack is more --> buy cans_package
# 2- if value of soda_per_liter is more than cans_package --> buy soda_liter
